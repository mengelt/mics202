              There are a number of ways this site could be improved:

              <ul>
                <li>Move computation off the main thread and into <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopenner" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers">web workers</a>. Currently, most calculators will seize the browser if sufficiently large numbers are used. </li>
                <li>Most of the calculators would benefit from hardening, more checks for invalid inputs</li>
                <li>Some calculators are not currently accepting negative numbers when they probably should be</li>
                <li>Translate user input into Sage input with copy and paste functionality (credit: Aaron Crouch)</li>
                <li>Automated tests for the core math functions</li>
                <li>Linting, code cleanup, general housekeeping</li>
              </ul>
