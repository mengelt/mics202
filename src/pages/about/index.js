              MICS202Tools is the final project for Jeremy Colvin, Mark Mengelt, and Callie Stull for Aaron Crouch&apos;s CYBER202 course during the Fall 2022 semester.

              The goal of the project was to create a resource with explaining recurring course concepts with easy to use calculators. While this site is not exhaustive, it provides a good base of concepts to help the MICS student. While Python+Sage are a far better technology decision for a site like this, JavaScript is used to keep costs as low as possible. 
              All calculations are run within the browser and do not use any additional bandwidth once the site is loaded.
